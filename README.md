Project Overview:

The Analog Clock project is a simple web application developed using vanilla JavaScript. It features an analog clock with dynamically generated hour markers and second bars. The clock retrieves the current time and updates the rotation of its hands accordingly, providing users with an accurate representation of the current time.

Key Features:

Dynamic Marker Generation: The project dynamically generates hour markers and second bars using JavaScript, ensuring the clock face is accurately represented.

Real-Time Updates: Utilizing JavaScript's Date object, the clock retrieves the current time and updates the rotation of its hands (hour, minute, and second) accordingly.

Continuous Time Update: The clock uses the setInterval method to continuously update its time every second, ensuring that it accurately reflects the current time.
